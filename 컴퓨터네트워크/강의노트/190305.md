# Data communications
- Communicate : to share information
- can be local or remote
## Telecommunication
- includes telephone, telegraph, television
- communication at **disatnce**
## Data communication
- exchange of data between two devices via some form of transmission media
- regardless of distance

# Components
- Message : the information to be communicated
- Sender : the device sending the message (= source, host, station)
- Receiver : the device receiving the message (= destination, target)
- Transmission media : physical **path** by which a message travels from sender to receiver
  (= link, channel, path, medium)
- Protocol : **a set of rules** governing data communication, 소통을 위한 rule

# Data flow
## Simplex
- unidirectional communication(단방향)
- uses entire capacity of the channel
- ex) CCTV, Keyboard
## Half-Duplex
- each station can be tx(Trasmission / sender) and rx(Receiver) **but not at the same time**
- uses entire capacity of the channel for each direction
- ex) 워키토키, PTT(push to talk) 무전기
## Full-Duplex
- both station can be both tx and rx **at the same time(simultaneously)**
- the capacity of the channel is divided between two directions
- ex) telephone network

# Networks
- definition : the interconnection of a set of devices capable of communication
- "DEVICE" : host(computer, desktop, laptop, phone, security system),
  connecting device(router, modem)
- 하나의 device를 거친다 = 1 hop,
  device를 거치는 작업을 몇번 하는가 = hop count,
  두번 이상 = multi hop
## Network criteria
- 짧은 시간에 많은 데이터를 주고 받는 것이 목표
- Performance : measured by transit time, response time and evaluated by throughput and delay
- Reliability : measured by frequency of failure, time it takes a link to recover from a failure
## Physical Structures
### Type of connections
- Point to Point : End to End(디바이스 두개가 서로 통신)
- Multipoint(= Multidrop) : time shared connection : Mainframe에서 링크를 통해 여러개의 device에 연결
