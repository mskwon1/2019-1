# Unified Process
- popular software development process for building object-oriented systems
## Iterative Development(= Iterative and Incremental development)
- 개발 과정을 작은 단위로 나눔(iterations)
- 나눠진 개발 과정은 각각의 Requirements analysis, design, implemntation, testing activities 과정을 거쳐야 함
- 시스템은 점진적으로(incrementally) 성장
- 장점
  높은 리스크를 완화시켜줌
  진행상황이 눈에보임
  피드백, 보수, 요구사항에 맞는 진행이 수월함
  복잡성이 덜함
### Lifecycle phases
- Inception : approximate, vague estimation
- Elaboration : refined vision, implemntation of the core architecture, resolution of high risks,
  identification of most req and scope, more realistic estimates
- Construction : iterative implemntation of the remaining low risk elements, preparation for development
- Transition : beta test, deployment
## Waterfall Model
- Requirements specification -> Design -> Implemntation -> Integration -> Tsting -> Installation -> Maintenance
## Agile Model
- early/frequent delivery of working sw
- close collaboration between developers and customers
- self-organizing teams
- focus on adaptation to changing circumstances
- assumption : Requirements always change
## Model-driven Development
- create models of the domain
- PIM과 PDM의 콜라보 -> running code 생성
- PIM은 순수한 realization of functional reqirements
